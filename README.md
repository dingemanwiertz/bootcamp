The files in this repository belong to the pre-sessional statistics bootcamp for incoming students on the MSc Social Research Methods and MSc Social Policy and Social Research at University College London (UCL). 

The files "Pre-sessional Statistics Bootcamp MSc SRM.pdf" and "Pre-sessional Statistics Bootcamp MSc SRM.ppt" cover the slides of the course including instructions for the student tasks. The .ppt file also contains some notes for several slides.  

The file "WDI_Data.dta" is the dataset used in the course and the file "Bootcamp Days 1 and 2.do" is a do-file containing all code used during the workshop as well as example code for the student tasks. 

This course was co-taught with Burak Sonmez. In case you have any questions, please contact me at d.wiertz@ucl.ac.uk.
